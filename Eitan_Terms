<dl>

  <dt>biomedical informatics (BMI)</dt>
  <dd>a branch of health metrics used to help medical professionals study and improve healthcare, such as Roger Day’s use of computational and biomathematical modeling to amplify precision in cancer treatment (TechTarget. 2022. “Definition: biomedical informatics”. Last modified, May 2018. https://www.techtarget.com/searchhealthit/definition/biomedical-informatics).
 </dd>

 <dt>bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)</dt>
 <dd>a method for measuring body composition that passes a weak electrical current through a patient’s body, such as for calculating how much fat and muscle a person has (Wikipedia. 2022. “Bioelectrical impedance analysis”. Last modified, 25 September 2022. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis).
 </dd>


 <dt>bioethics</dt>
 <dd>a system of values and rules for the study of living organisms (Mosby’s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions, 11th ed. (2019), s.v. “bioethics”).
 </dd>

 <dt>bioinstrument</dt>
 <dd>a type of device implanted into or attached to a living organism for recording physiological information, such as one’s heartbeat or blood oxygen level (Mosby’s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions, 11th ed. (2019), s.v. “bioinstrument”).
 </dd>

 <dt>biotechnology</dt>
 <dd>the study of the relationships between living organisms and machinery, such as the effects of computer equipment on office workers, and the industrial application of the results of this study, such as gene splicing (Mosby’s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions, 11th ed. (2019), s.v. “biotechnology”).
 </dd>

 <dt>biotelemetry</dt>
 <dd>the electronic transmission of physiological data, such as heart rate, body temperature, and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, by radio and telephone systems (Mosby’s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions, 11th ed. (2019), s.v. “biotelemetry”).
 </dd>

</dl>

### G &nbsp;

<dl>

 <dt>gene splicing</dt>
 <dd>a biotechnological process that involves inserting a copied strand of DNA from one source to another, such as the splicing of human genes that code for polio susceptibility into mice, which are normally immune (Mosby’s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions, 11th ed. (2019), s.v. “gene splicing”). 
</dd>

 <dt>gene therapy</dt>
 <dd>a medical procedure intended to replace unwanted genes with desired ones, whereby the desired genes are injected into the bloodstream of a patient suffering from a hereditary disease (Mosby’s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions, 11th ed. (2019), s.v. “gene therapy”).
 </dd>

</dl>

### R &nbsp;

<dl>

 <dt>recombinant DNA</dt>
 <dd>a DNA molecule whose genes have been rearranged in a desired sequence in order to engineer a new type of organism, such as mosquitoes that cannot carry the Zika virus (Mosby’s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions, 11th ed. (2019), s.v. “recombinant DNA”).
</dd>

</dl>

### S &nbsp;

<dl>

 <dt>synthetic biology</dt>
 <dd>a field of science focused on re-engineering organisms for new and useful purposes, such as adding photoreceptors to laboratory mice to help study their nocturnal habits (National Human Genome Research Institute. “Synthetic Biology”. Accessed, 27 November 2022. https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Synthetic-Biology#:~:text=Synthetic%20biology%20is%20a%20field,in%20medicine%2C%20manufacturing%20and%20agriculture.).
