## A
<dl>
<dt>	Authentication	</dt>	
   <dd>	A method that is used to confirm the identity of a user, through various means such as password entry or fingerprint scan. This allows them to have access to the system or files.  	</dd>
</dl>

## D
<dl>
   <dt>	Data Breach	</dt>
   <dd>	 This event happens when an intruder successfully accesses a previously secure network, gains control, and exposes personal data stored on that network. This data may include phone numbers, bank account information, and more.	</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
   <dt>	Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)	</dt>
   <dd>	Involves numerous hosts and users who inundate a website with a flood of requests. These requests lock up the system, forcing a temporary shutdown.	</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
   <dt>	Domain	</dt>
   <dd>	The name of a given to a set of computers and the associated routers, printers, and scanners, all connected, creating one entity.		</dd>
</dl>

## E
<dl>
   <dt>	Encryption	</dt>
   <dd>	When special coding is used on a network, or a computer, to protect from hackers. You can compare it to ciphers used by spies to send secret messages. 		</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
   <dt>	Exploit	</dt>
   <dd>	Used as a noun, indicates an attack on a computer system using either a series of commands, malicious software or infected data. 	 	</dd>
</dl>

## F
<dl>
   <dt>	Firewall	</dt>
   <dd>	Technology, hardware, or software, used to prevent intruders from accessing a system. </dd>
</dl>

## H
<dl>
   <dt>	Hacker, Black Hat</dt>
   <dd>	A hacker, motivated by greed, politics, or boredom, aims to access a system to cause mischief, damage, or theft.	</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
   <dt>	Hacker, White Hat	</dt>
   <dd>	Sometimes referred to as “ethical hackers,” these individuals test computer systems and servers to find vulnerabilities. 	The host invites them to do this to help identify areas where security needs improvement.	</dd>
</dl>


## M
<dl>
   <dt>	Malware	</dt>
  <dd>	Malware combines the words “malicious” and “software” to describe various harmful software used to infect or damage a system. Malware often gains access via spam emails. Examples include worms, viruses, and trojan horses.	</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
   <dt>	Man in the Middle Attack	</dt>
  <dd>	An attack on the “middleman” is an attack on the Wi-Fi system connecting users to the Internet that breaks the Wi-Fi’s encryption. It then uses this to steal your data because they’re now in the system.	</dd>
</dl>

## P

<dl>
   <dt>	Phishing	</dt>
   <dd>	A scam in which a hacker poses as a legitimate business or organization to fool the victim into giving them sensitive personal information or inducing them to click a link or attachment that ends up delivering malware. These schemes range from the amateurish, which a user can spot with a little due diligence, to the sophisticated, which are harder to detect.	</dd>
</dl>


## R

<dl>
   <dt>	Ransomware	</dt>
   <dd>	A form of malware that hijacks an organization’s or user’s operating system encrypts files and denies the user access until the owner sends ransom money to regain access. </dd>
</dl>

## S
<dl>
   <dt>	Spoofing	</dt>
   <dd>	When a hacker changes the IP address of an email to make the email appear to come from a trusted source.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
   <dt>	Spyware	</dt>
   <dd>	Hackers use Malware to spy on a user and the user's computer activities.  For example, a hacker uses Malware to infect a mobile device, such as a smartphone, which can then read the user's text messages, redirect phone calls, and identify the user's physical location.</dd>
</dl>

## T

<dl>
   <dt>	Trojan Horse	</dt>
   <dd>	Malware that looks innocent and misleads users of its true intent. The hacker now has back-door access to the system with control over the system.  	</dd>
</dl>


## V

<dl>
   <dt>	Virus	</dt>
   <dd>	Malware that changes corrupts or destroys information and is then passed on to other systems, usually by an otherwise benign means such as an email. In some cases, a virus can cause physical damage.</dd>
</dl>


<dl>
   <dt>	Virtual Private Network (VPN)		</dt>
   <dd> A virtual private network (VPN) creates a safe, encrypted online connection for internet users even when the user is working on shared or public networks. A VPN creates for the user more privacy and anonymity online or circumvents geographic-based blocking and censorship</dd>
</dl>


## W
<dl>
   <dt>	Worm	</dt>
   <dd>	Malware that reproduces itself so it can spread itself to other computers in a network. In some cases a worm exploits the automatic parts of an operating system that are invisible to the user.In some cases or eat up resources to slow down a system.
 	</dd>
